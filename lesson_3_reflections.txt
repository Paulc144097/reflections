When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  when you want feedback or collaboration from other people

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	You might not want or need the changes made on GitHub

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	
	forks is cloning specifically for github (used for github), clone makes exact
	copies of a branch (can use to clone from github to local or local to local

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	
	so that both copies are up to date with each other and future commits wont clash

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	
	In person; not being able to collaborate efficiently 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

	when you want a different feature, experiment, or pretty much any addition that
	with risk of introducing a bug. Change master directly is faster but with a branch 	its safer
